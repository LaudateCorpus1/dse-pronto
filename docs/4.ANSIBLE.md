# Runtime Operations

Some of the prep for Ansible will require awscli, Python3, and some supporting libraries.  If running on a Macbook,
[here](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/) are instructions for installing Python3:

```
brew install awscli python
python3 -m pip install --user boto3 nose tornado simple-yaml six awsretry
```
* **Note:** a previously installed "six" library may have root permissions; if you get an error, try the following:
```
sudo chown -R ${YOUR_USERNAME} $(python -m site --user-site)
python3 -m pip install --user --ignore-installed six
```
**If you've just gotten done deploying your cluster,** you'll need to wait a few minutes before proceeding to any remote
Ansible operations.  The AMI runs a lot of scripts during cloud-init, including locating the appropriate network device
and attaching it, then setting it as the `active_interface`.  Ansible can't connect to any nodes before this has happened.

The runtime operations of a Cassandra cluster tend to be specific to the application, schema, and overall automation tendencies.
That said, a few playbooks have been included here as examples.  They can be run via the [operations script](../core-components/operations.sh):
```
$ ./core-components/operations.sh
Usage:
  operations.sh
    -a : [Required] account name
    -v : [Required] vpc name
    -c : [Required] cluster name
    -o : [Required] operation
    -h : host ip (default: all)
```
The script will:

1. Find the bastion LB DNS name and active IP addresses of your cluster, and build an ssh_config file for Ansible (and you)
to use.
    * The script which generates the SSH config is [here](../core-components/scripts/ssh/build-ssh-config.sh) if you wish to run it separately.
    * To SSH, something along the lines of `ssh -F ./ssh_config <ip_address>` should work, provided you use the active ENI
after Terraform has run.
2. Build a host list for Ansible to consume.
3. Run the specified playbook.
    * Included options are init, start/stop/restart, mount/unmount, and restack.  Playbooks are [here](../core-components/ansible/playbooks).

**Note:** The "init" operation should be run first.  This will change the password for the cassandra user, provided you've
run the `init-secrets.sh` script.  See **"Setup - Passwords"** [here](1.INITIAL_SETUP.md).
